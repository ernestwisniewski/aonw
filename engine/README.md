# AoNW Rust Engine

This directory contains the deterministic engine for Age of New Worlds. Rust
owns canonical state, gameplay rules, recipient projections, save/replay
contracts, and the native boundaries used by Flutter, Godot, and Serverpod.

## Workspace

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `aonw_domain` | Canonical game state, entities, identifiers, topology, and fixed-point values. |
| `aonw_content` | Strict maps, scenarios, immutable rulesets, catalogs, and content hashes. |
| `aonw_contracts` | Current client API plus canonical state, save, and replay DTOs. |
| `aonw_contract_mapping` | Validated conversion between contracts and domain types. |
| `aonw_engine` | Commands, queries, deterministic transitions, evidence, and turn processing. |
| `aonw_local_runtime` | Transactional sessions, replay recording, caches, snapshots, and patches. |
| `aonw_flutter` | Panic-contained C ABI for Flutter Native Assets. |
| `aonw_godot` | Thin GDExtension over the shared client protocol. |
| `aonw_map_*` | Logical map authoring, deterministic generation, terrain compilation, and CLI adapters. |
| `aonw_testkit` | Strict canonical fixtures, bounded corpus loading, and structural comparison. |

Pure engine crates do not depend on Flutter, Godot, Serverpod, filesystem,
network, wall-clock time, or presentation code. Adapters translate the same
versioned client boundary; they do not implement rules or fallback to Dart.

## Runtime scope

Implemented runtime slices include movement, unit actions, logistics, combat,
cities, workers, roads, economy, production, research, diplomacy, objectives,
match outcome, recipient-safe projections, local sessions, saves and
bounded multi-segment exact replay. Strategic AI is deterministic, profile-aware,
strength-gated, and exercises the complete local runtime. Native persistence
uses atomic writes plus a last-known-good backup. Serverpod hosts the same Rust
runtime through its dedicated native boundary.

The engine and clients update one stable contract atomically. Internal DTOs do
not carry speculative versions, alternate readers, upcasters, aliases, or
compatibility fallbacks. Shared API and artifact versions remain because
independently built components consume them.

## Release qualification

A release commit satisfies all three conditions below:

1. E0-PS11 functionality is complete in Rust: commands, queries, integrated
   turn, AI, recipient projection, save/replay, and local sessions.
2. The client protocol and native ownership/panic contracts are internally
   consistent across Flutter, Godot, and Serverpod.
3. `make rust-engine-completion-check` passes on that commit, or its fast,
   evidence, deep, and security components pass in pinned GitHub jobs for the
   same commit.

During normal engine work, run the focused gate for the changed area; reserve
the full completion command for release qualification and CI.

## Quick start

Run from the repository root:

```sh
make rust-check
make rust-engine-check
make rust-engine-evidence-check
```

Focused functional gates include:

```sh
make rust-turn-kernel-check
make rust-movement-logistics-check
make rust-combat-check
make rust-city-check
make rust-worker-check
make rust-ai-check
make rust-persistence-check
```

Build or test the native adapters with:

```sh
make rust-flutter-test
make rust-godot-build
make godot-check
```

## Quality evidence

`cargo-llvm-cov` produces LLVM coverage and `stats_alloc` measures allocations.
Repository scripts add AoNW-specific census, provenance, ratchets, semantic work
counters, result signatures, and payload budgets; they do not replace those
external measurement tools. Line coverage is the release metric. Changed lines
are governed by the stricter full-crate ratio, uncovered-line, and missing-file
ratchets; branch coverage stays diagnostic until LLVM source mapping is stable
enough to ratchet. Renames require an explicit reviewed baseline update,
macros retain LLVM source attribution, reviewed globs are the only exclusions,
and small crates use the same per-crate rules. There is no arbitrary global
percentage target and no internal coverage schema version. Wall-clock benchmark
values are diagnostic only.

```sh
make rust-coverage-check
make rust-performance-check
make rust-architecture-check
make rust-dependency-check
make rust-determinism-check
make rust-security-policy-check
make rust-release-metadata-policy-check
```

Focused mutation testing uses pinned `cargo-mutants`; three bounded fuzz targets
use pinned `cargo-fuzz`/LibFuzzer with AddressSanitizer; Miri checks the pure
contract/domain boundary on one pinned nightly; and a real C consumer harness
checks the Flutter ABI with Clang AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
The harness proves valid ownership/null lifecycle and requires both response and
session double-free misuse to be diagnosed. It does not make invalid stale
handles legal. The policy is part of fast CI, while the expensive executions are
scheduled or run manually:

```sh
make rust-mutation-check
make rust-fuzz-smoke
make rust-miri-check
make rust-ffi-sanitizer-check
make rust-engine-security-check
```

The fuzz workspace has its own committed lockfile because it is intentionally
separate from the production workspace. Generated corpora and crash artifacts
are local evidence and are not committed.

Release supply-chain files use pinned external generators: OWASP
`cargo-cyclonedx 0.5.9` for CycloneDX 1.5 JSON and `cargo-about 0.9.2` with its
explicit `cli` feature for third-party notices. The repository checker isolates
workspace-wide generation from the source tree, selects the Flutter, Godot,
map-compiler, and server-native artifacts, binds output to the exact target and
commit epoch, and requires two byte-identical generations:

```sh
make rust-release-metadata-tool-versions
make rust-release-metadata-check
```

Generated SBOMs, notices, and their SHA-256 manifest are release artifacts under
`/tmp/aonw-rust-release-metadata`; they are uploaded by the scheduled deep gate
and are not committed as source.
