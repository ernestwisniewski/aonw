# ADR 0009: Dart Feature Freeze And Parallel Successor Clients

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-22
- Implementation: In progress

## Context

ADR 0008 establishes Rust as the successor engine while keeping the root Flutter application and `packages/aonw_core` releasable until retirement. Its wording protects the current product, but does not explicitly permit a new Flutter client before that retirement and still names the Godot client `clients/aonw2_godot`.

Waiting for complete Dart retirement would couple UI replacement to the longest part of the engine migration. Continuing feature development in the root Flutter application would also let presentation code and Dart rules grow together while Rust is becoming authoritative.

## Decision

The current Dart application becomes maintenance-only while successor clients are developed in parallel:

- `lib/` and `packages/aonw_core/` are feature-frozen at the tree OIDs recorded in `tool/legacy_freeze_manifest.v1`;
- the root Flutter application remains buildable and releasable, but receives no successor features;
- a freeze exception is limited to a critical production failure, security issue, or toolchain compatibility change;
- an exception requires separate owner approval, focused verification, and a reviewed manifest update;
- `test/` and `packages/aonw_core/test/` keep their current names and remain part of legacy regression coverage;
- normal successor workflows and code generators must not write into either frozen tree;
- the new Flutter client is built independently under `clients/aonw_flutter/` and must not depend on or import `package:aonw` or `package:aonw_core`;
- the existing Godot client will be renamed once to `clients/aonw_godot/`; a second Godot client will not be created;
- gameplay rules remain owned by the authoritative engine, never by Flutter widgets or GDScript.

This ADR supersedes ADR 0008 only for successor-client timing and physical client locations. ADR 0008 remains binding for engine ownership, parity, cutover, rollback, session backend pinning, and retirement.

## Consequences

The successor UI can advance in small vertical slices while the shipping application remains stable. The freeze makes accidental legacy feature work visible and keeps rollback available without creating another source of gameplay rules.

Critical maintenance changes carry an explicit review cost because the stored tree OID must change. Generated files inside frozen trees cannot be refreshed as an incidental part of successor work.

## Migration And Verification

`make p0-check` verifies the recorded tree OIDs, rejects staged and unstaged changes plus untracked additions in frozen trees, checks successor dependency boundaries, and runs negative fixtures proving that the guards fail closed.

Every successor checkpoint reports both current tree OIDs. A freeze exception updates the manifest only after its code change and regression evidence have been approved together.

## Rejected Alternatives

- Waiting for Dart retirement before starting the successor Flutter client.
- Copying the root Flutter application into the successor client.
- Maintaining two Godot clients.
- Allowing successor code generation to refresh frozen Dart sources.
