# Balance telemetry

Balance telemetry is a deterministic development report for the opening and mid-game. It is not save data, a remote analytics pipeline, or an automatic rebalance system.

## Questions it answers

The analyzer records milestones such as:

- first technology, building, second city, contact, and combat;
- dead-turn runs where the player makes no meaningful decision or progress;
- victory turn and condition;
- final technologies, science, cities, units, gold, and net gold;
- score-pressure advice and the manual decision type it points toward.

A sample contains a turn, canonical state, optional events, meaningful command counts, optional objective-action diagnostics, and optional outcome/economy data. It lives outside the save format and can come from tests, AI simulations, or playtest tooling.

A turn is not dead when the player issued a meaningful command, received a meaningful event, or the state shows visible progress such as exploration, movement, production, growth, a new city, or an improvement. Passive science progress alone does not make an otherwise empty turn meaningful.

## Targets

Tuning targets live in `BalanceTelemetryTuningTargets` and in the selected pace profile. Do not copy generated turn results into this document; they change as maps, AI, and costs change.

Findings use stable codes such as late first technology/contact/combat, a long dead-turn streak, or final pace outside configured guardrails. Completed conquest/domination outcomes may suppress irrelevant low-economy end-state warnings.

## Generate a report

```sh
cd packages/aonw_core
dart run tool/economy_simulation.dart --out ../../build/reports/ai-telemetry
```

The output under `build/reports/ai-telemetry/` is generated evidence for that run. Cite its path and date in balance reviews or release notes; do not commit its numbers as a permanent contract.
