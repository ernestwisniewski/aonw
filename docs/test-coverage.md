# Test coverage

Coverage is a regression gate for executable lines, not a target to maximize at the expense of useful tests.

## Measured scopes

| Scope | Production source | Runner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flutter app | `lib/` | Flutter tests, serial execution |
| Dart core | `packages/aonw_core/lib/` | Dart tests |
| Server | `server/lib/` | Server unit tests without external services |

The generated Serverpod client has a smoke test but no percentage target. PostgreSQL integration tests and the critical E2E journeys run separately.

## Commands

```sh
make coverage-check
```

Focused collection:

```sh
make flutter-coverage
make core-coverage
make server-coverage
```

`make coverage` is an alias for the complete collection and policy check.

## Policy

The committed baseline stores exact instrumented totals, portable covered-line floors, and eligible files missing from LCOV. The current run must keep the same census unless the source layout changed deliberately.

The historical ratchet prevents a refreshed baseline from hiding a regression:

- coverage ratio may not decrease per layer;
- uncovered lines may not increase;
- the missing-file set may only shrink;
- changed eligible lines require at least 90% coverage, overall and per changed layer.

Generated files, localization output, Serverpod output, and `lib/main.dart` are excluded centrally in `tool/coverage_policy.json`. Inline coverage-ignore markers are not allowed in handwritten production code.

## Updating the baseline

```sh
make coverage-snapshot
diff -u tool/coverage_baseline.json /tmp/aonw-coverage-baseline.json
```

Review the file census and every changed count. Do not lower a floor simply because one platform collected fewer hits; the committed values must remain portable across supported environments.
