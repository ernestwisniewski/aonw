Age of New Worlds is an open-source, turn-based 4X game built around a hex map.
The authoritative engine is written in Rust, the presentation clients use
Flutter/Flame and Godot, and online matches are hosted by Serverpod with the
same Rust rules and recipient projections used by local sessions.

## Quick start

Use the Flutter version pinned in [`.fvmrc`](.fvmrc). FVM is optional; Make uses `.fvm/flutter_sdk` automatically when it exists.

```sh
make bootstrap
make rust-engine-quality-check
make flutter-client-check
make godot-check
make server-test
```

`make bootstrap` installs the locked package graphs and the matching Serverpod CLI. It does not generate code, start Docker, or alter lockfiles.

The complete release qualification is `make release-check`. Useful focused
checks include:

```sh
make rust-engine-check
make rust-coverage-check
make rust-performance-check
make flutter-client-performance-check
make server-integration-test
```

## Run the Flutter client

For local play backed by the in-process Rust runtime:

```sh
make flutter-client-run
```

For the local multiplayer stack:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Replace every placeholder secret in .env.
make local-start
make local
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:8080`. Four local accounts are seeded as
`test1@example.test` through `test4@example.test`; the shared development
password is `AonwTest123!`.

Run the automated multiplayer smoke with:

```sh
make local-multiplayer-smoke
```

Stop the stack without removing its data:

```sh
make local-down
```

## Rust and Godot

```sh
make rust-check
make godot-check
make map-stage-1-check
make godot-editor
make godot-run
```

`make map-stage-1-check` compares normalized Flutter and Godot map semantics;
client-owned visual goldens remain separate and are never rewritten by this gate.

## Documentation

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). It explains which implementation is authoritative, where each subsystem lives, and which checks apply to a change, including [static analysis](docs/static-analysis.md), [critical journeys](docs/critical-e2e.md), [mutation testing](docs/mutation-testing.md), and [architecture budgets](docs/architecture-budgets.md).

Contribution setup and pull-request expectations are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Architecture decisions are indexed in [docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md).

## Localization

English is the source language in
`clients/aonw_flutter/lib/l10n/app_en.arb`. Regenerate localization output from
the Flutter client directory after changing ARB files.
